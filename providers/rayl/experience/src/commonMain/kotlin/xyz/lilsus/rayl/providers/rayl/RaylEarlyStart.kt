/**
 * Starts the pocket at process start, before any UI exists, so connecting overlaps app launch and
 * aiming the camera. The experience takes the pocket over when it mounts. Main thread only.
 *
 * TODO: Measure on devices whether pre-warming the Spark session after connect speeds up the
 * first payment. On hosted Regtest from a desktop, connect took ~1.2 s and the first operation
 * ~3-5 s versus ~1.5 s for later ones; a full sync absorbed that but took 11-13 s, and cheap
 * calls (user settings, fees, deposits) did not help.
