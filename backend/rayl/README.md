# Rayl backend

Serves `GET /v1/bitcoin/prices` ([wire contract](../../core/rayl-api)). Every 30 seconds it polls
mempool.space, Coinbase, Kraken and blockchain.info, and it answers with the per-currency
median of the quotes that are at most five minutes old. It returns 503 when no source is fresh.

Run locally on `127.0.0.1:8080`:

```sh
./gradlew :backend:rayl:run
```

Deploy to Railway (project `rayl-backend`, service `rayl`). The image packages the locally
built distribution, so Railway never configures the Gradle project:

```sh
./gradlew :backend:rayl:installDist
railway up backend/rayl --path-as-root --no-gitignore \
  -p 9bbf2625-4edc-4a92-bc7c-b3e9f6c840be -s rayl -e production --detach
```
